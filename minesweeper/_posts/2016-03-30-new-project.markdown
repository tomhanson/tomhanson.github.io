<p>Hi, I'm Tom. Welcome to my first project in my journey to become a better JavaScript developer - a version of Minesweeper that runs in the browser. Â Incase you arent aware what minesweeper is, it looks like this:</p>

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/post-images/minesweeper-thumbnail.png" alt="Minesweeper Thumbnail" width="268" height="300" />

<p>and you can play a version of it <a href="http://minesweeperonline.com/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p>Why minesweeper you may ask? well I deliberated for a while and decided it was a great starting point for object orientated JS. Complex enough to make it a real challenge but no so complex that this blog will be going on for the next 20 years while i figured it out!</p>

<p>I didn't really set myself any goals for this project aside from having a working version of the game but I did set myself one side challenge: no jQuery. Not because its bad or I don't like it/can't use it but just because in my opinion it takes away some of the challenge of the build and that sort of defeats the object.</p>

<p>So the big question then: where do I start?</p>
