<p>Welcome to project 2: a JavaScript slider.</p>

<p>Javascript sliders are an every day part of building websites, Generally people/companies have a favourite and they always stick to it. My favourite is slick and I will probably be sticking to it but I feel like a slider is going to be a 
really good project to learn some more JS.</p>

<p>So here I go again....</p>
