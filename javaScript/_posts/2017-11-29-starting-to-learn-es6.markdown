<p>Ok so the title isn't strictly true, I already know es6 to an extent. By that I mean that I have been using some of the simpler parts of it(mainly with React).</p>
<p>Firstly let me just say, I have done a few of Wes' free courses and I was very impressed with his style. I know its personal preference but it just worked for me, so I had high expectations.</p>
<p>I haven't been disappointed so far. Starting off on the 'basics' which I thought I was already well versed on it has added at the least an extra layer of understanding as to why things are happening and at best an extra bit of knowledge to add to my knowledge base.</p>
<p>Let me give you a basic example.</p>
<pre>
{
    let a = 0;
    var b = 1;
}
&nbsp;
console.log(a) //undefined 
console.log(b) //1

</pre>

<p>a var variable is function scoped wheras a let variable is block scoped. so looking at the above example you see that the var can leak outside of the curly braces whereas the let cannot.</p>
<p>A small difference I guess but just a little bit of extra knowledge to cement my understanding</p>
<p>I don't want to give the whole course away so you'll have to buy it yourself if you want to get the same knowledge you'll have to buy it yourself! </p>
