<p>It's been awful quiet here at Learning JS HQ. The truth is, I started my slider and then got sidetracked at work. I've still been learning away behind the scenes.</p>

<p>I've read an awesome book called <a href="https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS" target="_blank" rel="noopener">You dont know JS</a> and also watched a few good training courses
including numerous ones by <a href="http://wesbos.com/courses/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wes Bos</a> and <a href="https://reacttraining.com/online" target="_blank" rel="noopener">React Training</a> by Tyler McGinnis.</p>

<a href="http://minesweeperonline.com/" target="_blank">test</a>

<p>I also got sidetracker by a react project at work, so all in all a really busy few months! All of the above is good because:</p>

<ul>
<li>I've learned loads of new things, and my skills are really improving.</li>
<li>The things I've done have really increased my confidence in tackling Js problems</li>
</ul>
<p>But its also bad because, well, my awesome slider idea got put on hold, so that isnt done! :(</p>

<p>As I sat and thought about writing this blog post I realised that my goals had changed faster than the latest task runner! I am trying to really dig deep into React, I am going to try to keep posts about what I am doing as I come up against it
so it stays about my problem solving experience and hopefully that will help people see that they arent the only ones who are going through the learning curve pain!</P>

<p>Now I just need to go find myself something I can't build!</p>
