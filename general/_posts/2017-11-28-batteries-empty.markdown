<p>As you can see by my lack of activity here, I've recently found myself with other things getting in the way of my learning. Ok it is also partly down to a slight lack of motivation. I'm sure you can relate - I've been meaning to do loads of things but never quite getting round to it.</p>

<p>The solution? <a href="https://www.es6.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Learn something new</a></p>

<p>I finally decided to do one of those things on my list and purchased one of Wes Bos' courses(2 actually but that's for a later date). I've dipped my toes in since buying it and done around 15 of the 70+ videos and it has kicked me back into action.</p>

<p>I'm going to start talking about things I have been learning still and es6 for beginners will be no different.</p>

<p>Watch this space(again)...</p>
