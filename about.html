<p>I am a front End Developer and I love JavaScript. I'm getting better at it every day and the purpose of this blog is to document my journey to become a better JavaScript developer</p>
<p>I do this stuff in my own time so I will add to it as and when I can but hopefully at least semi-regularly.</p>
<p>If you're reading this and have any advice, tips or criticism(preferably of the constructive variety) then I would love to hear it. Drop me a message on my contact form <a href="/contact">here</a></p>
